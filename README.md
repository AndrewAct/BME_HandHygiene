# BME_HandHygiene
Solution for BioHack 2021. Coded by Andrew Chen, designed by Shivam Gangal, Andrew Chen, and Harinie Jeyabalan.


## Inspiration 
Hand-washing has been proved an efficient method to reduce the spread of pandemics, especially during such a period everybody is concerned about COVID-19. However, is there a method to monitor the hand-washing process? Out of this consideration, our team developed this project.

## Difficulties we encountered 
1. Build an ML is not hard, but it is difficult to capture and analyze real-time images.

2. The provided dataset may not be large enough.

3. Choose an appropriate algorithm and deploy it.

## Our Methodology 
Deploy machine learning in hospitals' cameras. On the on hand, it will supervise operators and patients to wash hand routinely. On the other hand, it will mandate people to wash their hands in the correct procedure.



CV2 and TensorFlow are the primary libraries of this project. Although it has not been applied to the real world, it is capable of analyzing video data and detection. We will modify these features and incorporate them into real-world devices if possible!

## Expectations 
"Incorporation": Incorporate this device into a camera so that it can be installed easily.

"Instantaneous": Add a memory chip to this device and enhance its ability to analyze real-time images. 

"In real-world": Perform tasks on more real-world images. The complexity would increase and the algorithm should be enhanced.
