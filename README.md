# BME_HandHygiene
Solution for BioHack 2021. Coded by Andrew Chen, designed by Shivam Gangal, Andrew Chen, and Harinie Jeyabalan.


## Inspiration 
Hand-washing has been proved an efficient method to reduce the spread of pandemics, especially during such a period everybody is concerned about COVID-19. However, is there a method to monitor the hand-washing process? Out of this consideration, our team developed this project.

## Difficulties we encountered 
1. Build an ML is not hard, but it is difficult to capture and analyze real-time images.

2. The provided dataset may not be large enough.

3. Choose an appropriate algorithm and deploy it.

## Our Methodology 

## Expectations 
"Incorporation": Incorporate this device into a camera so that it can be installed easily.

"Instantaneous": Add a memory chip to this device and enhance its ability to analyze real-time images. 

"In real-world": Perform tasks on more real-world images. The complexity would increase and the algorithm should be enhanced.
